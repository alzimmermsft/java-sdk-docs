# Use the Azure Libraries for Java

The open-source Azure libraries for Java simplify provisioning, managing, and using Azure resources from Java application code.

## Important details

* The Azure libraries are how you communicate with Azure services from Java code that you run either locally or in the cloud. (Whether you can run Java code within the scope of a particular service depends on whether that service itself currently supports Java.)
* The libraries support Java 8 and later, and are tested against both the Java 8 baseline as well as the latest Java 'long-term support' release.
* The libraries include full Java module support, which means that they are fully compliant with the requirements of a Java module and export all relevant packages for use.
* The Azure SDK for Java is composed solely of over many individual Java libraries that relate to specific Azure services. There are no other tools in the "SDK".
